# 1.  Create a variable for your favorite number (can be a float like 7.5).
# Naming convention for identifiers is snake_case
life_the_universe_and_everything = 42.123
# 2.  Create a variable for your favorite food (a string).
fav_food = 'Black Forest Torte'
# 3.  **USE** an f-string with `print()` to display a sentence like:
# "My favorite food is [YourFood] and my favorite number is [YourNumber]."
print(f'My favorite food is {fav_food} and my favorite number is {life_the_universe_and_everything}.')
# 4.  If your number was a float, try printing it again using an f-string,
# but format it to display with only one decimal place (e.g., `:.1f`).
print(f'My favorite number (formatted) is {life_the_universe_and_everything:.1f}')
